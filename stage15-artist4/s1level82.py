"""Stage 15: Puzzle 1 of 10

This puzzle shows you how the `draw_square()` and `draw_circle()`
functions are defined. Defining a function doesn't run its blocks. You
have to call `draw_square()` function to actually draw a square. Note:
in this Python version of code.org you have seen these functions all
along in the Stage 11 puzzle code but we focus on them now to explain
how to define them.
