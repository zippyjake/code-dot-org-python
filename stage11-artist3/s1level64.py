"""Stage 11: Puzzle 6 of 11

Ok, this program will use a counter to draw the same squares as last time
(50,60,70,80,90). You want the square to be the same size as the counter,
so use the "counter" loop. Here's how:

Counter loops are the same as the simple `for counter in range(4):` loops
just with extra `range()` parameters and we actually use the `counter`
variable that gets set every time through the loop. It doesn't have to
be named `counter` but we use that name for consistency in these puzzles.

    for counter in range(5,51,5):
        print(counter)

The first number (5) is the one to start with.

The second number (51) is the maximum plus 1. We add a 1 so that 50 will
be included.

The third (5) is how much to count by (5,10,15,...50).

Even though we have to add 1 to count the way we want, note how much
cleaner Python loops are than the ones used in JavaScript (from 'Show
Code') and other languages.
